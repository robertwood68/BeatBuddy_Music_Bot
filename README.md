**Update** As of now, BeatBuddy is being completely refactored to work in agreement with YouTube's copyright policy, and due to this the bot will be offline for a few weeks.  Stay tuned for updates on the bot as it'll be back up in no time!

BeatBuddy is a Discord Music bot developed using Node.js.  At this time, BeatBuddy supports a wide variety of commands which can be found on its website https://beatbuddy.robertwood.dev or through inviting the bot to your server and typing "/" to pull up the newly developed slash commands!

Thanks for using BeatBuddy!

# BeatBuddy - Discord Music Bot
![alt text](https://github.com/robertwood68/BeatBuddy_Music_Bot/blob/master/images/BB.png?raw=true)

BeatBuddy is a Discord Music bot developed using Node.js.  At this time, BeatBuddy supports a wide variety of commands which can be found on its website https://www.beatbuddybot.com or through inviting the bot to your server and typing "//help" or "//h".

BeatBuddy is able to play music from multiple sources for all of the users in the voice channel to listen to.  As of late, the bot can play music based off of YouTube links and keyword searches, Spotify links, and SoundCloud links, all of which have playlist and podcast support too.  Just type "//play (song or playlist link here)", and soon BeatBuddy will join the voice channel that you are in and begin to play the song or playlist that you requested.

The project originally started development with the intention of locally hosting it for a small number of people to use.  However, it has grown into a publicly hosted bot that is in plenty of servers, and I even developed a website for the bot for easy use, contacting me regarding issues with the bot, and more.

Thanks for using BeatBuddy!
